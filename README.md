### Koala Kwote: Assignment 2 for Intro to Software Engineering ELEC1005
#### Lab 02 Group 17

This is a rudimentary implementation of a group project for a class, made with Microsoft PowerApps and a Sharepoint database.

### User Manual
Koala Kwote is an all-in-one solution for managing health-insurance without hassle, allowing you to easily generate and view personalised health insurance plans, book a consultation with an expert and complete health insurance payments.

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The GUI for Koala Kwote is as simple and universal as possible, allowing for seamless and easy navigation across the application without any confusion.

The main interface for Koala Kwote is divided into two sections, a header bar, which allows for easy navigation, with buttons to navigate between various pages of the application, and a main page below, which contains all relevant page contents such as forms, log in, consultation booking, etc.

#### Generating a new quotation
If new to using the application, you can generate a new health insurance quotation and personalised healthcare plans by clicking the button on the homepage. This will redirect to the dedicated form page, which will contain a variety of inputs via text or select boxes. To generate a new quote, the details on the form must be filled out entirely, as they are used for the calculation of the personalised plan. 

Upon completing the form via the submit button at the bottom of the page, an account will be automatically created for you, and you will be brought to a page which displays a health insurance plan specifically tailored to you based on your information. You can press on any of the cards for the plans to select the plan or press on the login button at the bottom to sign into your new account.

#### Dashboard
When you have been signed into your account, either as a new user from the plans page, or from the homepage as a returning user, you will be brought to a central dashboard page, allowing you to manage and access your healthcare plan, payments, consultation bookings and personal details.

##### Booking a Consultation
Although personal plans based on individual details are provided, choosing a plan and deciding between a variety of insurance providers can still be difficult. Koala Kwote allows you to book an online or in-person consultation with an expert to help find the right plan at the right price. The page dedicated to booking a healthcare insurance consultation can be found from the main dashboard. On click, you will be brought to our calendly page, where a date for the consultation can be selected, allowing you to view availability for both in person and online consultations and to make a booking.

##### Updating Personal Details
As your personal living situation may change over time, Koala Kwote allows you to edit and update their previously entered details from when they initially signed up. When editing details, the user’s details will be re-evaluated and they will be provided new personalised options for plans.

##### Making Your Payment
We’ve made paying for your insurance plan as simple as a few clicks. The payment page can be found from the main dashboard, on which you will be redirected to our Stripe page where the payment can be completed with absolute confidence on security.
